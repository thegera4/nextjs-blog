## Personal Blog Project

In this project, I built a website for my own personal blog taking advantage of NextJs features like file base routing, server side rendering and dynamic paths. I'm also using a mongoDb database to store the message that you send me in the contact form!

You can visit the webpage an try it here: [Go to my blog](https://nextjs-blog-flax-theta.vercel.app/)

Alternatively, you can download/clone the project an run it locally in your machine:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result
